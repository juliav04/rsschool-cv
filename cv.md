## About Me
I graduated from Samara National Research University from the faculty of Foreign Philology (Foreign Literature & the English language) in July 2021. During last 4 years I've been working as a tutor of English and 
doing some translations of technical documentation. English is my passion and I know it quite enough to speak fluently.  
At the end of summer 2021 I found some information about the sphere of IT in which I was never interested, to be honest. I took part in some online IT-marathons and decided that Frontend seemed interesting to me. Later my friend (who works as a web developer) recommended me courses from EPAM. I was late for stage 0 and did my best at stage 1, but I didn't have enough knowledge to continue. That's why I waited till December and started stage 0.  
I consider myself a very responsible and hardworking person who always achieves the set goals. I hope to finish the courses successfully, pass the interview and get a job in the sphere of Frontend. My excellent knowledge of English and 
tenacity should help me with this.
